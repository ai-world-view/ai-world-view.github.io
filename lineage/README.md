# lineage/ — the canonical seeds & framework kit

This directory is the **source of truth** for the self-growing knowledge-base
lineage. The country repos hold only their *content* (plus a GitHub Pages
`_config.yml`, `.claude/`, and `telemetry/`); the hub owns the seed and
orchestrates their growth.

- `seeds/<country>.md` — each country's **concept definition**: subject,
  taxonomy, source strategy (for this org: the model's **own world view** — no
  web research), conventions, and its Evolution Log. The orchestrator reads
  these to grow each repo.
- `seed-package/` — the **portable bootstrap kit** planted into a new repo when
  a lineage spawns: `seed.template.md`, `lifecycle.template.yml`, `MANIFEST.md`.
- `policy.yml` — the **canonical growth policy**: the 3-tier model escalation
  (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus), perpetual-growth rules, `cadence.repos_per_run`
  (stalest-first rotation — enforced by `orchestrate.yml`), the `preview:`
  banner art direction (the grow tick's Illustrate step), and auth.
- `framework/` — the **canonical agent toolkit** (`prompts/`, `skills/`,
  `agents/`) that the hub's central grow workflow stages into a cloned country
  repo to run a tick. `workflows/` and `scripts/lineage.sh` are the retired
  peer-to-peer engine, kept as reference but **excluded from staging** — they
  are unreachable under the central model.

The reference implementation of this model (including its Architecture
Decision Records and the org-genome replant tooling this hub was planted
from) lives at
[year-of-ai/year-of-ai.github.io](https://github.com/year-of-ai/year-of-ai.github.io).

Excluded from the Jekyll build (see `_config.yml`) — this is orchestration data,
not site content. The published lineage view is `pages/lineage.md` (`/lineage/`).
